### ⚠️ Troubleshooting

#### Backend Issues:
- **Port already in use?** Make sure no other Flask app is running on port 3000
- **Database connection failed?** Check your MySQL server is running
- **Import errors?** Make sure you're in the correct backend directory

#### Frontend Issues:
- **Metro bundler error?** Try `npx expo start --clear` to clear cache
- **Can't connect to backend?** Check the IP address in `config.js` matches your computer's IP
- **Expo Go not loading?** Make sure your phone and computer are on the same WiFi network

1. Customize the search filters to match your business needs
