## 🧪 **How to Test the Fixes:**

### **Step 1: Start Your Frontend**
```bash
# Open PowerShell as Administrator (one-time fix)
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned

# Navigate to frontend
cd "d:\CS491\clone\CS491-ChefAsap\frontend"

# Start Expo (your preferred method)
npx expo start -w
```

### **Step 2: Test Date/Time Pickers**
1. **Tap on Date field** - Should open date picker
2. **Select a future date** - Should update the display
3. **Tap on Time field** - Should open time picker  
4. **Select a time** - Should update the display
5. **Check console** - Should show "Date picker button pressed" logs

### **Step 3: Test Chef Search**
1. **Select Cuisine**: Choose "Italian" (we have Italian chefs in data)
2. **Enter Zip Code**: Enter any zip like "60601"
3. **Set Number of People**: Enter "2" or any number
4. **Tap "🔍 Find Available Chefs"**
5. **Expected Results**: 
   - Loading state: "🔍 Searching..."
   - Success alert: "Found X chef(s) for you!"
   - Modal opens with chef results

### **Step 4: Verify Chef Results Display**
You should see chefs like:
- **Mario Rossi** (Chicago, Italian) - $75/hr
- **Sophie Chen** (New York, Chinese) - $85/hr  
- **James Wilson** (Los Angeles, American) - $80/hr
- And more with ratings, locations, and "Book This Chef" buttons

## 🔍 **Debugging Features Added:**

### Console Logs (Check Expo DevTools)
- `🔘 Search button touched!` - When you tap the button
- `📡 Calling API: [URL]` - Shows the API request
- `📋 API Response: [data]` - Shows server response
- `👨‍🍳 Mapped chefs: [chefs]` - Shows processed chef data

### Error Handling
- **Network errors**: Clear message with connection troubleshooting
- **No results**: Helpful message suggesting filter changes
- **API errors**: Specific error messages from server

## 🎯 **Expected Test Flow:**
```
1. Open app → Landing Page ✅
2. Tap "📅 Book a Chef" → Booking Form ✅
3. Fill form (cuisine, date, time, zip) → Fields working ✅
4. Tap "🔍 Find Available Chefs" → API call ✅
5. See success alert → Modal opens ✅
6. Browse chef results → Chef cards displayed ✅
7. Tap "Book This Chef" → Booking integration ✅
```

## 🚨 **If Something Still Doesn't Work:**

### **Date/Time Issues:**
- Check Expo DevTools console for "Date picker button pressed"
- Try different platforms (phone vs web browser)
- Ensure @react-native-community/datetimepicker is installed

### **Search Button Issues:**  
- Check console for "🔘 Search button touched!"
- Verify backend server is running (should show in terminal)
- Test API directly: `http://192.168.1.181:3000/api/bookings/search-chefs?cuisine_type=Italian`

### **No Chef Results:**
- Try different cuisine types: Italian, Chinese, American, Mexican
- Check zip code field isn't empty
- Look for console logs showing API response data
